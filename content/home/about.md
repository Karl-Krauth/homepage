# Biography

I am a second year PhD student in [computer science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Jonathan Ragan-Kelley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrk/) and [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I am a member of the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). I'm currently spending the summer at Amazon search as an applied scientist intern.

Prior to coming to Berkeley I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science at the University of New South Wales where I was supervised by [Gernot Heiser](http://gernot-heiser.org/) for my honour's thesis. I also had the good fortune of working with [Edwin Bonilla](http://ebonilla.github.io/) as a research assistant.
